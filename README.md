##Idea
Our aim is to solve the problem faced by people when they want to purchase new dress. We want to help people to identify the right clothes for them using image processing. A photo will be take of the person who want to purchase certain dress, then the image is processed to identify if the desired size will fit him and predict where the dress can be tight or loose.

##Download

To get the git version do

`git clone https://github.com/parsoyaarihant/vision.git`

##Documentation and usage

To install the required libraries to the folder and run:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

>> still in development phase hence its better to run the `test.py`file to see whats been done so far.
